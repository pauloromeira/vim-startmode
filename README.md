# Vim start mode

The missing mode.

#### Overall idea
1. Intends to be a new vim mode that appears when creating a new tab/window or starting vim without specifying files. 
1. Remaps 'S' to enter start mode, since 'cc' and 'S' are synonyms (not sure if it's a good idea).
1. Offers a new grammar to view/open files, sessions and projects (e.g. ls -> list sessions).
1. Provides bookmark functionality and lists recently opened files/directories.
1. Window/tab easily closed just by pressing 'q' in start mode.
