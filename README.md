# Vim start mode - the missing mode

## Overall idea
Intends to be a new vim mode that appears when creating a new tab/window or starting vim without specifying files.
  - Remap 'S' to enter start mode, since 'cc' and 'S' are synonyms. (not sure if it's a good idea)
Offers a new set of shortcuts to open files, sessions and projects.
Provides bookmark functionality and lists recently opened files/directories.
Window/tab easily closed just by pressing 'q' in start mode.
